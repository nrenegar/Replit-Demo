1,"Genetic diversity, phylogeography, and maternal origin of yak (Bos grunniens).","There is no consensus as to the origin of the domestic yak (Bos grunniens). Previous studies on yak mitochondria mainly focused on mitochondrial displacement loop (D-loop), a region with low phylogenetic resolution. Here, we analyzed the entire mitochondrial genomes of 509 yaks to obtain greater phylogenetic resolution and a comprehensive picture of geographical diversity. A total of 278 haplotypes were defined in 509 yaks from 21 yak breeds. Among them, 28 haplotypes were shared by different varieties, and 250 haplotypes were unique to specific varieties. The overall haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity of yak were 0.979 ± 0.0039 and 0.00237 ± 0.00076, respectively. Phylogenetic tree and network analysis showed that yak had three highly differentiated genetic branches with high support rate. The differentiation time of clades I and II were about 0.4328 Ma, and the differentiation time of clades (I and II) and III were 0.5654 Ma. Yushu yak is shared by all haplogroups. Most (94.70%) of the genetic variation occurred within populations, and only 5.30% of the genetic variation occurred between populations. The classification showed that yaks and wild yaks were first clustered together, and yaks were clustered with American bison as a whole. Altitude had the highest impact on the distribution of yaks. Yaks have high genetic diversity and yak populations have experienced population expansion and lack obvious phylogeographic structure. During the glacial period, yaks had at least three or more glacial refugia.",Bmc Genomics,eng,2024,May,2024-05-16,2024-05-15,"Xingdong Wang, Jie Pei, Lin Xiong, Pengjia Bao, Min Chu, Xiaoming Ma, Yongfu La, Chunnian Liang, Ping Yan, Xian Guo","Key Laboratory of Yak Breeding in Gansu Province, Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, 730050, P.R.

2,Aberrant CHCHD2-associated mitochondriopathy in Kii ALS/PDC astrocytes.,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Parkinsonism-Dementia Complex (ALS/PDC), a rare and complex neurological disorder, is predominantly observed in the Western Pacific islands, including regions of Japan, Guam, and Papua. This enigmatic condition continues to capture medical attention due to affected patients displaying symptoms that parallel those seen in either classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Parkinson's disease (PD). Distinctly, postmortem examinations of the brains of affected individuals have shown the presence of α-synuclein aggregates and TDP-43, which are hallmarks of PD and classical ALS, respectively. These observations are further complicated by the detection of phosphorylated tau, accentuating the multifaceted proteinopathic nature of ALS/PDC. The etiological foundations of this disease remain undetermined, and genetic investigations have yet to provide conclusive answers. However, emerging evidence has implicated the contribution of astrocytes, pivotal cells for maintaining brain health, to neurodegenerative onset, and likely to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of ALS/PDC. Leveraging advanced induced pluripotent stem cell technology, our team cultivated multiple astrocyte lines to further investigate the Japanese variant of ALS/PDC (Kii ALS/PDC). CHCHD2 emerged as a significantly dysregulated gene when disease astrocytes were compared to healthy controls. Our analyses also revealed imbalances in the activation of specific pathways: those associated with astrocytic cilium dysfunction, known to be involved in neurodegeneration, and those related to major neurological disorders, including classical ALS and PD. Further in-depth examinations revealed abnormalities in the mitochondrial morphology and metabolic processes of the affected astrocytes. A particularly striking observation was the reduced expression of CHCHD2 in the spinal cord, motor cortex, and oculomotor nuclei of patients with Kii ALS/PDC. In summary, our findings suggest a potential reduction in the support Kii ALS/PDC astrocytes provide to neurons, emphasizing the need to explore the role of CHCHD2 in maintaining mitochondrial health and its implications for the disease.",Acta Neuropathologica,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-15,"Nicolas Leventoux, Satoru Morimoto, Mitsuru Ishikawa, Shiho Nakamura, Fumiko Ozawa, Reona Kobayashi, Hirotaka Watanabe, Sopak Supakul, Satoshi Okamoto, Zhi Zhou, Hiroya Kobayashi, Chris Kato, Yoshifumi Hirokawa, Ikuko Aiba, Shinichi Takahashi, Shinsuke Shibata, Masaki Takao, Mari Yoshida, Fumito Endo, Koji Yamanaka, Yasumasa Kokubo, Hideyuki Okano","Department of Physiology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38750212/,200.0
3,Ironing out the role of ferroptosis in immunity.,"Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death that drives the pathophysiology of many diseases. Oxidative stress is detectable in many types of regulated cell death, but only ferroptosis involves lipid peroxidation and iron dependency. Ferroptosis originates and propagates from several organelles, including the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and lysosomes. Recent data have revealed that immune cells can both induce and undergo ferroptosis. A mechanistic understanding of how ferroptosis regulates immunity is critical to understanding how ferroptosis controls immune responses and how this is dysregulated in disease. Translationally, more work is needed to produce ferroptosis-modulating immunotherapeutics. This review focuses on the role of ferroptosis in immune-related diseases, including infection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. We discuss how ferroptosis is regulated in immunity, how this regulation contributes to disease pathogenesis, and how targeting ferroptosis may lead to novel therapies.",Immunity,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-15,"Hannah N Bell, Brent R Stockwell, Weiping Zou","Department of Surgery, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Center of Excellence for Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Rogel Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Graduate Program in Cancer Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Graduate Program in Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

4,N-MYC impairs innate immune signaling in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is a challenging disease, especially for patients with immunologically ""cold"" tumors devoid of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). We found that HGSC exhibits among the highest levels of <i>MYCN</i> expression and transcriptional signature across human cancers, which is strongly linked to diminished features of antitumor immunity. N-MYC repressed basal and induced IFN type I signaling in HGSC cell lines, leading to decreased chemokine expression and T cell chemoattraction. N-MYC inhibited the induction of IFN type I by suppressing tumor cell-intrinsic STING signaling via reduced STING oligomerization, and by blunting RIG-I-like receptor signaling through inhibition of MAVS aggregation and localization in the mitochondria. Single-cell RNA sequencing of human clinical HGSC samples revealed a strong negative association between cancer cell-intrinsic <i>MYCN</i> transcriptional program and type I IFN signaling. Thus, N-MYC inhibits tumor cell-intrinsic innate immune signaling in HGSC, making it a compelling target for immunotherapy of cold tumors.",Science Advances,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-15,"Alex Miranda, Swetansu Pattnaik, Phineas T Hamilton, Monica Alvaro Fuss, Shreena Kalaria, Céline M Laumont, Julian Smazynski, Monica Mesa, Allyson Banville, Xinpei Jiang, Russell Jenkins, Israel Cañadas, Brad H Nelson","Deeley Research Centre, BC Cancer, Victoria, BC V8R 6V5, Canada.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38748789/,214.0
5,Bacteria-organelle communication in physiology and disease.,"Bacteria, omnipresent in our environment and coexisting within our body, exert dual beneficial and pathogenic influences. These microorganisms engage in intricate interactions with the human body, impacting both human health and disease. Simultaneously, certain organelles within our cells share an evolutionary relationship with bacteria, particularly mitochondria, best known for their energy production role and their dynamic interaction with each other and other organelles. In recent years, communication between bacteria and mitochondria has emerged as a new mechanism for regulating the host's physiology and pathology. In this review, we delve into the dynamic communications between bacteria and host mitochondria, shedding light on their collaborative regulation of host immune response, metabolism, aging, and longevity. Additionally, we discuss bacterial interactions with other organelles, including chloroplasts, lysosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).",The Journal Of Cell Biology,eng,2024,Jul,2024-05-15,2024-05-15,"Yi-Tang Lee, Mumine Senturk, Youchen Guan, Meng C Wang","Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38748249/,5.0
6,FMNL2 regulates actin for endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria distribution in oocyte meiosis.,"During mammalian oocyte meiosis, spindle migration and asymmetric cytokinesis are unique steps for the successful polar body extrusion. The asymmetry defects of oocytes will lead to the failure of fertilization and embryo implantation. In present study, we reported that an actin nucleating factor Formin-like 2 (FMNL2) played critical roles in the regulation of spindle migration and organelle distribution in mouse and porcine oocytes. Our results showed that FMNL2 mainly localized at the oocyte cortex and periphery of spindle. Depletion of FMNL2 led to the failure of polar body extrusion and large polar bodies in oocytes. Live-cell imaging revealed that the spindle failed to migrate to the oocyte cortex, which caused polar body formation defects, and this might be due to the decreased polymerization of cytoplasmic actin by FMNL2 depletion in the oocytes of both mice and pigs. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicated that FMNL2 was associated with mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related proteins, and FMNL2 depletion disrupted the function and distribution of mitochondria and ER, showing with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and the occurrence of ER stress. Microinjecting <i>Fmnl2-EGFP</i> mRNA into FMNL2-depleted oocytes significantly rescued these defects. Thus, our results indicate that FMNL2 is essential for the actin assembly, which further involves into meiotic spindle migration and ER/mitochondria functions in mammalian oocytes.",Elife,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-16,"Meng-Hao Pan, Kun-Huan Zhang, Si-Le Wu, Zhen-Nan Pan, Ming-Hong Sun, Xiao-Han Li, Jia-Qian Ju, Shi-Ming Luo, Xiang-Hong Ou, Shao-Chen Sun","College of Animal Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38747713/,184.0
7,lncRNA Oip5-as1 inhibits excessive mitochondrial fission in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by modulating DRP1 phosphorylation.,"Aberrant mitochondrial fission, a critical pathological event underlying myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury, has emerged as a potential therapeutic target. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Oip5-as1 is increasingly recognized for its regulatory roles, particularly in MI/R injury. However, its precise mechanistic role in modulating mitochondrial dynamics remains elusive. This study aims to elucidate the mechanistic role of Oip5-as1 in regulating mitochondrial fission and evaluate its therapeutic potential against MI/R injury. To simulate in vitro MI/R injury, HL-1 cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Lentiviral vectors were employed to achieve overexpression or knockdown of Oip5-as1 in HL-1 cells by expressing Oip5-as1 or shRNA targeting Oip5-as1, respectively. The impact of Oip5-as1 on mitochondrial dynamics in HL-1 cells was assessed using CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, and biochemical assays. MI/R injury was induced in mice by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Conditional knockout mice for Oip5-as1 were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology, while overexpression of Oip5-as1 in mice was achieved via intramyocardial administration of AAV9 vectors. In mice, the role of Oip5-as1 was evaluated through echocardiographic assessment, histopathological staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, Western blotting, RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, and co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to investigate Oip5-as1's underlying mechanisms. The expression levels of Oip5-as1 are significantly decreased in MI/R-injured HL-1 cells and myocardium. In HL-1 cells undergoing H/R injury, overexpression of Oip5-as1 attenuated excessive mitochondrial fission, preserved mitochondrial functionality, and reduced cellular apoptosis, while knockdown of Oip5-as1 exhibited the opposite effects. Furthermore, in a mouse model of MI/R injury, overexpression of Oip5-as1 diminished mitochondrial fission, myocardial infarct size and improved cardiac function. However, knockout of Oip5-as1 exacerbated myocardial injury and cardiac dysfunction, which were significantly reversed by treatment with a mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1). Mechanistically, Oip5-as1 selectively interacts with AKAP1 and CaN proteins, inhibiting CaN activation and subsequent DRP1 dephosphorylation at Ser637, thereby constraining DRP1's translocation to the mitochondria and its involvement in mitochondrial fission. Our study underscores the pivotal role of Oip5-as1 in mitigating excessive mitochondrial fission during MI/R injury. The findings not only enhance our comprehension of the molecular mechanisms underlying MI/R injury but also identify Oip5-as1 as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating MI/R injury.",Cellular & Molecular Biology Letters,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-14,"Xiaowei Niu, Jingjing Zhang, Shuwen Hu, Wenhui Dang, Kaiwen Wang, Ming Bai","Department of Cardiology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38745296/,5.0
8,Exploring the neuroprotective role of artesunate in mouse models of anti-NMDAR encephalitis: insights from molecular mechanisms and transmission electron microscopy.,"The pathway involving PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and PARKIN plays a crucial role in mitophagy, a process activated by artesunate (ART). We propose that patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis exhibit insufficient mitophagy, and ART enhances mitophagy via the PINK1/PARKIN pathway, thereby providing neuroprotection. Adult female mice aged 8-10 weeks were selected to create a passive transfer model of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. We conducted behavioral tests on these mice within a set timeframe. Techniques such as immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting were employed to assess markers including PINK1, PARKIN, LC3B, p62, caspase3, and cleaved caspase3. The TUNEL assay was utilized to detect neuronal apoptosis, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to examine mitochondrial autophagosomes. Primary hippocampal neurons were cultured, treated, and then analyzed through immunofluorescence for mtDNA, mtROS, TMRM. In comparison to the control group, mitophagy levels in the experimental group were not significantly altered, yet there was a notable increase in apoptotic neurons. Furthermore, markers indicative of mitochondrial leakage and damage were found to be elevated in the experimental group compared to the control group, but these markers showed improvement following ART treatment. ART was effective in activating the PINK1/PARKIN pathway, enhancing mitophagy, and diminishing neuronal apoptosis. Behavioral assessments revealed that ART ameliorated symptoms in mice with anti-NMDAR encephalitis in the passive transfer model (PTM). The knockdown of PINK1 led to a reduction in mitophagy levels, and subsequent ART intervention did not alleviate symptoms in the anti-NMDAR encephalitis PTM mice, indicating that ART's therapeutic efficacy is mediated through the activation of the PINK1/PARKIN pathway. At the onset of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, mitochondrial damage is observed; however, this damage is mitigated by the activation of mitophagy via the PINK1/PARKIN pathway. This regulatory feedback mechanism facilitates the removal of damaged mitochondria, prevents neuronal apoptosis, and consequently safeguards neural tissue. ART activates the PINK1/PARKIN pathway to enhance mitophagy, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects and may achieve therapeutic goals in treating anti-NMDAR encephalitis.",Cell Communication And Signaling : Ccs,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-16,"Jingsi Liu, Yingyi Huang, Tinglin Qian, Jinyu Chen, Yuewen Ding, Zhaohui Lai, Xinghua Zhong, Mingjun Lai, Huili Zhang, Yuanyuan Wang, Honghao Wang, Yu Peng","Department of Neurology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38745240/,5.0
9,Astaxanthin-mediated Nrf2 activation ameliorates glucocorticoid-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired bone formation of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head in rats.,"Osteonecrosis of the femoral head caused by glucocorticoids (GIONFH) is a significant issue resulting from prolonged or excessive clinical glucocorticoid use. Astaxanthin, an orange-red carotenoid present in marine organisms, has been the focus of this study to explore its impact and mechanism on osteoblast apoptosis induced by dexamethasone (Dex) and GIONFH. In this experiment, bioinformatic prediction, molecular docking and dynamics simulation, cytotoxicity assay, osteogenic differentiation, qRT-PCR analysis, terminal uridine nickend labeling (TUNEL) assay, determination of intracellular ROS, mitochondrial function assay, immunofluorescence, GIONFH rat model construction, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scans were performed. Our research demonstrated that a low dose of astaxanthin was non-toxic to healthy osteoblasts and restored the osteogenic function of Dex-treated osteoblasts by reducing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. Furthermore, astaxanthin rescued the dysfunction in poor bone quality, bone metabolism and angiogenesis of GIONFH rats. The mechanism behind this involves astaxanthin counteracting Dex-induced osteogenic damage by activating the Nrf2 pathway. Astaxanthin shields osteoblasts from glucocorticoid-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction via Nrf2 pathway activation, making it a potential therapeutic agent for GIONFH treatment.",Journal Of Orthopaedic Surgery And Research,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-14,"Weidan Wang, Hongyi Jiang, Jiachen Yu, Chao Lou, Jian Lin","The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang Province, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38745231/,60.0
10,EP4-induced mitochondrial localization and cell migration mediated by CALML6 in human oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Lymph node metastasis, primarily caused by the migration of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells, stands as a crucial prognostic marker. We have previously demonstrated that EP4, a subtype of the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor, orchestrates OSCC cell migration via Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. The exact mechanisms by which EP4 influences cell migration through Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, however, is unclear. Our study aims to clarify how EP4 controls OSCC cell migration through this pathway. We find that activating EP4 with an agonist (ONO-AE1-473) increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and the migration of human oral cancer cells (HSC-3), but not human gingival fibroblasts (HGnF). Further RNA sequencing linked EP4 to calmodulin-like protein 6 (CALML6), whose role remains undefined in OSCC. Through protein-protein interaction network analysis, a strong connection is identified between CALML6 and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2), with EP4 activation also boosting mitochondrial function. Overexpressing EP4 in HSC-3 cells increases experimental lung metastasis in mice, whereas inhibiting CaMKK2 with STO-609 markedly lowers these metastases. This positions CaMKK2 as a potential new target for treating OSCC metastasis. Our findings highlight CALML6 as a pivotal regulator in EP4-driven mitochondrial respiration, affecting cell migration and metastasis via the CaMKK2 pathway.",Communications Biology,eng,2024,May,2024-05-14,2024-05-14,"Soichiro Ishikawa, Masanari Umemura, Rina Nakakaji, Akane Nagasako, Kagemichi Nagao, Yuto Mizuno, Kei Sugiura, Mitomu Kioi, Kenji Mitsudo, Yoshihiro Ishikawa","Cardiovascular Research Institute, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38745046/,58.0

It allows, in particular, the computation of the electromagnetic field and the related energetic quantities in the stimulated organelles.

12,Mitochondrial dysfunction: mechanisms and advances in therapy.,"Mitochondria, with their intricate networks of functions and information processing, are pivotal in both health regulation and disease progression. Particularly, mitochondrial dysfunctions are identified in many common pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. However, the multifaceted nature and elusive phenotypic threshold of mitochondrial dysfunction complicate our understanding of their contributions to diseases. Nonetheless, these complexities do not prevent mitochondria from being among the most important therapeutic targets. In recent years, strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction have continuously emerged and transitioned to clinical trials. Advanced intervention such as using healthy mitochondria to replenish or replace damaged mitochondria, has shown promise in preclinical trials of various diseases. Mitochondrial components, including mtDNA, mitochondria-located microRNA, and associated proteins can be potential therapeutic agents to augment mitochondrial function in immunometabolic diseases and tissue injuries. Here, we review current knowledge of mitochondrial pathophysiology in concrete examples of common diseases. We also summarize current strategies to treat mitochondrial dysfunction from the perspective of dietary supplements and targeted therapies, as well as the clinical translational situation of related pharmacology agents. Finally, this review discusses the innovations and potential applications of mitochondrial transplantation as an advanced and promising treatment.",Signal Transduction And Targeted Therapy,eng,2024,May,2024-05-14,2024-05-14,"Yao Zong, Hao Li, Peng Liao, Long Chen, Yao Pan, Yongqiang Zheng, Changqing Zhang, Delin Liu, Minghao Zheng, Junjie Gao","Centre for Orthopaedic Research, Medical School, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, 6009, Australia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38744846/,83.0
13,"2-APQC, a small-molecule activator of Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), alleviates myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis by regulating mitochondrial homeostasis.","Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is well known as a conserved nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide<sup>+</sup> (NAD<sup>+</sup>)-dependent deacetylase located in the mitochondria that may regulate oxidative stress, catabolism and ATP production. Accumulating evidence has recently revealed that SIRT3 plays its critical roles in cardiac fibrosis, myocardial fibrosis and even heart failure (HF), through its deacetylation modifications. Accordingly, discovery of SIRT3 activators and elucidating their underlying mechanisms of HF should be urgently needed. Herein, we identified a new small-molecule activator of SIRT3 (named 2-APQC) by the structure-based drug designing strategy. 2-APQC was shown to alleviate isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis in vitro and in vivo rat models. Importantly, in SIRT3 knockout mice, 2-APQC could not relieve HF, suggesting that 2-APQC is dependent on SIRT3 for its protective role. Mechanically, 2-APQC was found to inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/ small mother against decapentaplegic 3 (Smad3) pathways to improve ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. Based upon RNA-seq analyses, we demonstrated that SIRT3-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) axis was closely assoiated with HF. By activating PYCR1, 2-APQC was shown to enhance mitochondrial proline metabolism, inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS)-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) pathway and thereby protecting against ISO-induced mitochondrialoxidative damage. Moreover, activation of SIRT3 by 2-APQC could facilitate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-Parkin axis to inhibit ISO-induced necrosis. Together, our results demonstrate that 2-APQC is a targeted SIRT3 activator that alleviates myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis by regulating mitochondrial homeostasis, which may provide a new clue on exploiting a promising drug candidate for the future HF therapeutics.",Signal Transduction And Targeted Therapy,eng,2024,May,2024-05-14,2024-05-14,"Fu Peng, Minru Liao, Wenke Jin, Wei Liu, Zixiang Li, Zhichao Fan, Ling Zou, Siwei Chen, Lingjuan Zhu, Qian Zhao, Gu Zhan, Liang Ouyang, Cheng Peng, Bo Han, Jin Zhang, Leilei Fu","West China School of Pharmacy and Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center and State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38744811/,83.0
14,METTL8 links mt-tRNA m<sup>3</sup>C modification to the HIF1α/RTK/Akt axis to sustain GBM stemness and tumorigenicity.,"Epitranscriptomic RNA modifications are crucial for the maintenance of glioma stem cells (GSCs), the most malignant cells in glioblastoma (GBM). 3-methylcytosine (m<sup>3</sup>C) is a new epitranscriptomic mark on RNAs and METTL8 represents an m<sup>3</sup>C writer that is dysregulated in cancer. Although METTL8 has an established function in mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) m<sup>3</sup>C modification, alternative splicing of METTL8 can also generate isoforms that localize to the nucleolus where they may regulate R-loop formation. The molecular basis for METTL8 dysregulation in GBM, and which METTL8 isoform(s) may influence GBM cell fate and malignancy remain elusive. Here, we investigated the role of METTL8 in regulating GBM stemness and tumorigenicity. In GSC, METTL8 is exclusively localized to the mitochondrial matrix where it installs m<sup>3</sup>C on mt-tRNA<sup>Thr/Ser(UCN)</sup> for mitochondrial translation and respiration. High expression of METTL8 in GBM is attributed to histone variant H2AZ-mediated chromatin accessibility of HIF1α and portends inferior glioma patient outcome. METTL8 depletion impairs the ability of GSC to self-renew and differentiate, thus retarding tumor growth in an intracranial GBM xenograft model. Interestingly, METTL8 depletion decreases protein levels of HIF1α, which serves as a transcription factor for several receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes, in GSC. Accordingly, METTL8 loss inactivates the RTK/Akt axis leading to heightened sensitivity to Akt inhibitor treatment. These mechanistic findings, along with the intimate link between METTL8 levels and the HIF1α/RTK/Akt axis in glioma patients, guided us to propose a HIF1α/Akt inhibitor combination which potently compromises GSC proliferation/self-renewal in vitro. Thus, METTL8 represents a new GBM dependency that is therapeutically targetable.",Cell Death & Disease,eng,2024,May,2024-05-14,2024-05-14,"Bernice Woon Li Lee, You Heng Chuah, Jeehyun Yoon, Oleg V Grinchuk, Yajing Liang, Jayshree L Hirpara, Yating Shen, Loo Chien Wang, Yan Ting Lim, Tianyun Zhao, Radoslaw M Sobota, Tseng Tsai Yeo, Andrea Li Ann Wong, Kejia Teo, Vincent Diong Weng Nga, Bryce Wei Quan Tan, Toshio Suda, Tan Boon Toh, Shazib Pervaiz, Zhewang Lin, Derrick Sek Tong Ong","Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117593, Singapore.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38744809/,5.0
15,Requirements for the biogenesis of [2Fe-2S] proteins in the human and yeast cytosol.,"The biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) proteins entails the synthesis and trafficking of Fe/S clusters, followed by their insertion into target apoproteins. In eukaryotes, the multiple steps of biogenesis are accomplished by complex protein machineries in both mitochondria and cytosol. The underlying biochemical pathways have been elucidated over the past decades, yet the mechanisms of cytosolic [2Fe-2S] protein assembly have remained ill-defined. Similarly, the precise site of glutathione (GSH) requirement in cytosolic and nuclear Fe/S protein biogenesis is unclear, as is the molecular role of the GSH-dependent cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins (cGrxs). Here, we investigated these questions in human and yeast cells by various in vivo approaches. [2Fe-2S] cluster assembly of cytosolic target apoproteins required the mitochondrial ISC machinery, the mitochondrial transporter Atm1/ABCB7 and GSH, yet occurred independently of both the CIA system and cGrxs. This mechanism was strikingly different from the ISC-, Atm1/ABCB7-, GSH-, and CIA-dependent assembly of cytosolic-nuclear [4Fe-4S] proteins. One notable exception to this cytosolic [2Fe-2S] protein maturation pathway defined here was yeast Apd1 which used the CIA system via binding to the CIA targeting complex through its C-terminal tryptophan. cGrxs, although attributed as [2Fe-2S] cluster chaperones or trafficking proteins, were not essential in vivo for delivering [2Fe-2S] clusters to either CIA components or target apoproteins. Finally, the most critical GSH requirement was assigned to Atm1-dependent export, i.e. a step before GSH-dependent cGrxs function. Our findings extend the general model of eukaryotic Fe/S protein biogenesis by adding the molecular requirements for cytosolic [2Fe-2S] protein maturation.",Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America,eng,2024,May,2024-05-14,2024-05-14,"Joseph J Braymer, Oliver Stehling, Martin Stümpfig, Ralf Rösser, Farah Spantgar, Catharina M Blinn, Ulrich Mühlenhoff, Antonio J Pierik, Roland Lill","Institut für Zytobiologie und Zytopathologie, Fachbereich Medizin, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Marburg 35032, Germany.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38743629/,838.0
16,Metformin induction of heat shock factor 1 activation and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response alleviate cardiac remodeling in spontaneously hypertensive rats.,"Heart failure and cardiac remodeling are both characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. Healthy mitochondria are required for adequate contractile activity and appropriate regulation of cell survival. In the mammalian heart, enhancement of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is cardioprotective under pressure overload conditions. We explored the UPRmt and the underlying regulatory mechanism in terms of hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling and the cardioprotective effect of metformin. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats and angiotensin II-treated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were used to induce cardiac hypertrophy. The results showed that hypertension induced the formation of aberrant mitochondria, characterized by a reduced mtDNA/nDNA ratio and swelling, as well as lower levels of mitochondrial complexes I to V and inhibition of the expression of one protein subunit of each of complexes I to IV. Such changes eventually enlarged cardiomyocytes and increased cardiac fibrosis. Metformin treatment increased the mtDNA/nDNA ratio and regulated the UPRmt, as indicated by increased expression of activating transcription factor 5, Lon protease 1, and heat shock protein 60, and decreased expression of C/EBP homologous protein. Thus, metformin improved mitochondrial ultrastructure and function in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In vitro analyses revealed that metformin reduced the high levels of angiotensin II-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in such animals and stimulated nuclear translocation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Moreover, HSF1 small-interfering RNA reduced the metformin-mediated improvements in mitochondrial morphology and the UPRmt by suppressing hypertrophic signals and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. These results suggest that HSF1/UPRmt signaling contributes to the beneficial effects of metformin. Metformin-mediated targeting of mitochondrial protein homeostasis and modulation of HSF1 levels have potential therapeutic implications in terms of cardiac remodeling.",Faseb Journal : Official Publication Of The Federation Of American Societies For Experimental Biology,eng,2024,May,2024-05-08,2024-05-08,"Man Xu, Li-Peng Li, Xi He, Xing-Zhu Lu, Xue-Yuan Bi, Qi Li, Xiao-Rong Xue","Department of Pharmacy, Xi'an People's Hospital (Xi'an Fourth Hospital), Northwest University Affiliated People's Hospital, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38717442/,5.0
17,Identifying the Potential Apoptotic Metabolites in Postmortem Beef Muscle by Targeted Metabolomics.,"Apoptotic cells may release specific metabolites to act as messengers during the apoptotic process. This study represents the first attempt to identify potential apoptotic metabolites in postmortem muscle. Ninety potential apoptotic metabolites in beef were selected and analyzed through targeted metabolomics, with 84 of them exhibiting significant differences over the postmortem time. Following the addition of the mitochondria-targeted antiapoptotic agent mitoquinone to postmortem muscle, metabolomic analysis revealed that 73 apoptotic metabolites still underwent significant changes, even against the backdrop of altered apoptosis. Of these 73 apoptotic metabolites, 54 exhibited similar trends at various treatment times with adding mitoquinone, including lipids (6), amino acids (27), nucleosides (11), and carbohydrate and energy metabolism (10). Mitoquinone significantly reduced the levels of most apoptotic metabolites, and inhibition of apoptosis resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of numerous apoptotic metabolites. Consequently, these apoptotic metabolites are considered complementary to apoptosis in postmortem muscle, with their increased levels potentially promoting apoptosis. Noteworthy apoptotic metabolites, such as glycerol 3-phosphate, serine, AMP, ATP, GMP, and creatine, were identified as active signaling molecules that attract and recruit phagocytes during apoptosis, assisting in recognizing apoptotic cells by phagocytes. This study provides, for the first time, insights into potential apoptotic metabolites in postmortem muscle, contributing to a better understanding of meat biochemistry.",Journal Of Agricultural And Food Chemistry,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-15,"Bo Zou, Han Wang, Miaolin Duan, Yingying Sun, Yana Liu, Xingmin Li, Ruitong Dai","College of Food Science and Nutritional Engineering, China Agricultural University, No. 17 Qinghua East Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100083, PR China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38710026/,328.0
18,Simultaneous targeting of peripheral and brain tumors with a therapeutic nanoparticle to disrupt metabolic adaptability at both sites.,"Brain metastasis of advanced breast cancer often results in deleterious consequences. Metastases to the brain lead to significant challenges in treatment options, as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents conventional therapy. Thus, we hypothesized that creation of a nanoparticle (NP) that distributes to both primary tumor site and across the BBB for secondary brain tumor can be extremely beneficial. Here, we report a simple targeting strategy to attack both the primary breast and secondary brain tumors utilizing a single NP platform. The nature of these mitochondrion-targeted, BBB-penetrating NPs allow for simultaneous targeting and drug delivery to the hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane of the extracranial primary tumor site in addition to tumors at the brain. By utilizing a combination of such dual anatomical distributing NPs loaded with therapeutics, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept idea to combat the increased metabolic plasticity of brain metastases by lowering two major energy sources, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis. By utilizing complementary studies and genomic analyses, we demonstrate the utility of a chemotherapeutic prodrug to decrease OXPHOS and glycolysis by pairing with a NP loaded with pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 inhibitor. Decreasing glycolysis aims to combat the metabolic flexibility of both primary and secondary tumors for therapeutic outcome. We also address the in vivo safety parameters by addressing peripheral neuropathy and neurobehavior outcomes. Our results also demonstrate that this combination therapeutic approach utilizes mitochondrial genome targeting strategy to overcome DNA repair-based chemoresistance mechanisms.",Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America,eng,2024,May,2024-05-06,2024-05-06,"Akash Ashokan, Shrita Sarkar, Mohammad Z Kamran, Bapurao Surnar, Akil A Kalathil, Alexis Spencer, Shanta Dhar","NanoTherapeutics Research Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38709930/,838.0
19,Exogenous and Endogenous Dual-Activated Nanoladder for Precise Imaging of Mitochondrial Ferroptosis-Related Inhibition miRNA with Tumor Cell Specificity.,"Developing precise tumor cell-specific mitochondrial ferroptosis-related inhibition miRNA imaging methods holds enormous potential for anticancer drug screening and cancer treatment. Nevertheless, traditional amplification methods still tolerated the limited tumor specificity because of the ""off-tumor"" signal leakage resulting from their ""always-active"" sensing mode. To overcome this limitation, we herein developed a dual (exogenous 808 nm NIR light and endogenous APE1) activated nanoladder for precise imaging of mitochondrial ferroptosis-related miRNA with tumor cell specificity and improved imaging resolution. Exogenous NIR light-activation can regulate the ferroptosis-related inhibition miRNA imaging signals within mitochondria, and endogenous enzyme-activation can confine signals to tumor cells. Based on this dual activation design, off-tumor signals were greatly reduced and tumor-to-background contrast was enhanced with an improved tumor/normal discrimination ratio, realizing tumor cell-specific precise imaging of mitochondrial ferroptosis-related inhibition miRNA.",Analytical Chemistry,eng,2024,May,2024-05-14,2024-05-14,"Yue Yin, Shuwei Chen, Haiming Li, Xiaozhe Pang, Congkai Wang, Lei Wang, Pingping Liu, Shenghao Xu, Xiliang Luo","Key Laboratory of Optic-electric Sensing and Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, MOE; College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao 266042, P.

However, limited information is available regarding its toxicity, especially at environmentally relevant concentrations. In the present study, adult male zebrafish were exposed to varying concentrations of BTBPE (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L) for 28 days. The results demonstrated underperformance in mating behavior and reproductive success of male zebrafish when paired with unexposed females. Additionally, a decline in sperm quality was confirmed in BTBPE-exposed male zebrafish, characterized by decreased total motility, decreased progressive motility, and increased morphological malformations. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, an integrated proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis was performed, revealing a predominant impact on mitochondrial functions at the protein level and a universal response across different cellular compartments at the phosphorylation level. Ultrastructural damage, increased expression of apoptosis-inducing factor, and disordered respiratory chain confirmed the involvement of mitochondrial impairment in zebrafish testes. These findings not only provide valuable insights for future evaluations of the potential risks posed by BTBPE and similar chemicals but also underscore the need for further research into the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on reproductive health.",Environmental Science & Technology,eng,2024,May,2024-05-14,2024-05-14,"Na Zheng, Xiaochen Wang, Yindan Zhang, Jianghuan Hua, Biran Zhu, Yuxi Zhou, Zhixiang Xu, Lijun Luo, Jian Han, Lihua Yang, Bingsheng Zhou","State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38695612/,5.0
21,Light-Driven Mitochondrion-to-Nucleus DNA Cascade Fluorescence Imaging and Enhanced Cancer Cell Photoablation.,"Nucleic acids are mainly found in the mitochondria and nuclei of cells. Detecting nucleic acids in the mitochondrion and nucleus in cascade mode is crucial for understanding diverse biological processes. This study introduces a novel nucleic acid-based fluorescent styrene dye (SPP) that exhibits light-driven cascade migration from the mitochondrion to the nucleus. By introducing <i>N</i>-arylpyridine on one side of the styrene dye skeleton and a bis(2-ethylsulfanyl-ethy)-amino unit on the other side, we found that SPP exhibits excellent DNA specificity (16-fold, <i>F</i><sup>DNA</sup>/<i>F</i><sup>free</sup>) and a stronger binding force to nuclear DNA (-5.09 kcal/mol) than to mitochondrial DNA (-2.59 kcal/mol). SPP initially accumulates in the mitochondrion and then migrates to the nucleus within 10 s under light irradiation. By tracking the damage to nucleic acids in apoptotic cells, SPP allows the successful visualization of the differences between apoptosis and ferroptosis. Finally, a triphenylamine segment with photodynamic effects was incorporated into SPP to form a photosensitizer (MTPA-SPP), which targets the mitochondria for photosensitization and then migrates to the nucleus under light irradiation for enhanced photodynamic cancer cell treatment. This innovative nucleic acid-based fluorescent molecule with light-triggered mitochondrion-to-nucleus migration ability provides a feasible approach for the in situ identification of nucleic acids, monitoring of subcellular physiological events, and efficient photodynamic therapy.",Journal Of The American Chemical Society,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-15,"Tianping Xia, Zhuoran Xia, Peichen Tang, Jiangli Fan, Xiaojun Peng","State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Frontier Science Center for Smart Materials, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38685727/,674.0

Through the synthesized di-cationic fluorophore, we investigate the monitoring of viscosity, ferroptosis, stress-induced mitophagy, and lysosomal uptake of damaged mitochondria. The designed fluorophore is based on DQAsomes, cationic vesicles responsible for transporting drugs and DNA to mitochondria. The symmetric fluorophores possess two charge centres separated by an alkyl chain and are distinguished by a pyridinium group for mitochondrial selectivity, the C-12 alkyl substitution for membrane affinity, and an electron donor-π-acceptor fluorescent scaffold for intramolecular charge transfer. The synthesized fluorophores, PP and NP, emit wavelengths exceeding 600 nm, with a significant Stokes shift (130-211 nm), and NP demonstrates near-infrared emission (∼690 nm).

23,Triphenylphosphonium-functionalized dimeric BODIPY-based nanoparticles for mitochondria-targeting photodynamic therapy.,"The dimerization of boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) moieties is an appealing molecular design approach for developing heavy-atom-free triplet photosensitizers (PSs). However, BODIPY dimer-based PSs generally lack target specificity, which limits their clinical use for photodynamic therapy. This study reports the synthesis of two mitochondria-targeting triphenylphosphonium (TPP)-functionalized meso-β directly linked BODIPY dimers (BTPP and BeTPP). Both BODIPY dimers exhibited solvent-polarity-dependent singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) quantum yields, with maximum values of 0.84 and 0.55 for BTPP and BeTPP, respectively, in tetrahydrofuran. The compact orthogonal geometry of the BODIPY dimers facilitated the generation of triplet excited states <i>via</i> photoinduced charge separation (CS) and subsequent spin-orbit charge-transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT-ISC) processes and their rates were dependent on the energetic configuration between the frontier molecular orbitals of the two BODIPY subunits. The as-synthesized compounds were amphiphilic and hence formed stable nanoparticles (∼36 nm in diameter) in aqueous solutions, with a zeta potential of ∼33 mV beneficial for mitochondrial targeting. <i>In vitro</i> experiments with MCF-7 and HeLa cancer cells indicated the effective localization of BTPP and BeTPP within cancer-cell mitochondria. Under light irradiation, BTPP and BeTPP exhibited robust photo-induced therapeutic effects in both cell lines, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of ∼30 and ∼55 nM, respectively.",Nanoscale,eng,2024,May,2024-05-16,2024-05-16,"Chanwoo Kim, Duy Khuong Mai, Joomin Lee, Jinwoong Jo, Soyeon Kim, Isabel Wen Badon, Jong Min Lim, Ho-Joong Kim, Jaesung Yang","Department of Chemistry, Yonsei University, Wonju, Gangwon 26493, Korea. jaesung.yang@yonsei.ac.kr.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38639449/,268.0
24,The impact of HBx protein on mitochondrial dynamics and associated signaling pathways strongly depends on the hepatitis B virus genotype.,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are strongly associated with liver cirrhosis, inflammation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this context, the viral HBx protein is considered as a major factor influencing HBV-associated pathogenesis through deregulation of multiple cellular signaling pathways and is therefore a potential target for prognostic and therapeutic applications. However, HBV-associated pathogenesis differs significantly between genotypes, with the relevant factors and in particular the contribution of the genetic diversity of HBx being largely unknown. To address this question, we studied the specific genotype-dependent impact of HBx on cellular signaling pathways, focusing in particular on morphological and functional parameters of mitochondria. To exclusively investigate the impact of HBx of different genotypes on integrity and function of mitochondria in the absence of additional viral factors, we overexpressed HBx in Huh7 or HepG2 cells. Key signaling pathways were profiled by kinome analysis and correlated with expression levels of mitochondrial and pathogenic markers. Conclusively, HBx of genotypes A and G caused strong disruption of mitochondrial morphology alongside an induction of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. These effects were only moderately dysregulated by genotypes B and E, whereas genotypes C and D exhibit an intermediate effect in this regard. Accordingly, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and elevated reactive oxygen species production were associated with the HBx-mediated dysfunction among different genotypes. Also, genotype-related differences in mitophagy induction were identified and indicated that HBx-mediated changes in the mitochondria morphology and function strongly depend on the genotype. This indicates a relevant role of HBx in the process of genotype-dependent liver pathogenesis of HBV infections and reveals underlying mechanisms.IMPORTANCEThe hepatitis B virus is the main cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and differs in terms of pathogenesis and clinical outcome among the different genotypes. Furthermore, the viral HBx protein is a known factor in the progression of liver injury by inducing aberrant mitochondrial structures and functions. Consequently, the selective removal of dysfunctional mitochondria is essential to maintain overall cellular homeostasis and cell survival. Consistent with the intergenotypic difference of HBV, our data reveal significant differences regarding the impact of HBx of different genotypes on mitochondrial dynamic and function and thereby on radical oxygen stress levels within the cell. We subsequently observed that the induction of mitophagy differs significantly across the heterogenetic HBx proteins. Therefore, this study provides evidence that HBx-mediated changes in the mitochondria dynamics and functionality strongly depend on the genotype of HBx. This highlights an important contribution of HBx in the process of genotype-dependent liver pathogenesis.",Journal Of Virology,eng,2024,May,2024-05-14,2024-05-16,"Anja Schollmeier, Michael Basic, Mirco Glitscher, Eberhard Hildt","Division of Virology, Paul Ehrlich Institute, Langen, Germany.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38629837/,315.0
25,NS7a of SADS-CoV promotes viral infection via inducing apoptosis to suppress type III interferon production.,"Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a newly discovered swine coronavirus with potential cross-species transmission risk. Although SADS-CoV-induced host cell apoptosis and innate immunity antagonization has been revealed, underlying signaling pathways remain obscure. Here, we demonstrated that infection of SADS-CoV induced apoptosis <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, and that viral protein NS7a is mainly responsible for SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis in host cells. Furthermore, we found that NS7a interacted with apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria associated 1 (AIFM1) to activate caspase-3 via caspase-6 in SADS-CoV-infected cells, and enhanced SADS-CoV replication. Importantly, NS7a suppressed poly(I:C)-induced expression of type III interferon (IFN-λ) via activating caspase-3 to cleave interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and caspase-3 inhibitor protects piglets against SADS-CoV infection <i>in vivo</i>. These findings reveal how SADS-CoV induced apoptosis to inhibit innate immunity and provide a valuable clue to the development of effective drugs for the clinical control of SADS-CoV infection.IMPORTANCEOver the last 20 years, multiple animal-originated coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2, have caused millions of deaths, seriously jeopardized human health, and hindered social development, indicating that the study of animal-originated coronaviruses with potential for cross-species transmission is particularly important. Bat-originated swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), discovered in 2017, can not only cause fatal diarrhea in piglets, but also infect multiple human cells, with a potential risk of cross-species transmission, but its pathogenesis is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that NS7a of SADS-CoV suppresses IFN-λ production via apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria associated 1 (AIFM1)-caspase-6-caspase-3-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathway, and caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-FMK) can effectively inhibit SADS-CoV replication and protect infected piglets.

26,Cadmium exposure induced neuronal ferroptosis and cognitive deficits via the mtROS-ferritinophagy pathway.,"Exposure to environmental cadmium (Cd) is known to cause neuronal death and cognitive decline in humans. Ferroptosis, a novel iron-dependent type of regulated cell death, is involved in various neurological disorders. In the present study, Cd exposure triggered ferroptosis in the mouse hippocampus and in the HT22 murine hippocampal neuronal cell line, as indicated by significant increases in ferroptotic marker expression, intracellular iron levels, and lipid peroxidation. Interestingly, ferroptosis of hippocampal neurons in response to Cd exposure relied on the induction of autophagy since the suppression of autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ) substantially ameliorated Cd-induced ferroptosis. Furthermore, nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated degradation of ferritin was required for the Cd-induced ferroptosis of hippocampal neurons, demonstrating that NCOA4 knockdown decreased intracellular iron levels and lipid peroxidation and increased cell survival, following Cd exposure. Moreover, Cd-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) generation was essential for the ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis of hippocampal neurons. Importantly, pretreatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) effectively attenuated Cd-induced hippocampal neuronal death and cognitive impairment in mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that ferroptosis is a novel mechanism underlying Cd-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive impairment and that the mtROS-ferritinophagy axis modulates Cd-induced neuronal ferroptosis.","Environmental Pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",eng,2024,May,2024-05-04,2024-05-04,"Dongmei Wang, Yiran Wu, Xiang Zhou, Chen Liang, Yilu Ma, Quan Yuan, Ziyue Wu, Xueqin Hao, Xiaoying Zhu, Xinyu Li, Jian Shi, Junliang Chen, Hua Fan","College of Basic Medicine and Forensic Medicine, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38621452/,5.0
27,The Arabidopsis Mitochondrial Nucleoid-Associated Protein WHIRLY2 Is Required for a Proper Response to Salt Stress.,"In the last years, plant organelles have emerged as central coordinators of responses to internal and external stimuli, which can induce stress. Mitochondria play a fundamental role as stress sensors being part of a complex communication network between the organelles and the nucleus. Among the different environmental stresses, salt stress poses a significant challenge and requires efficient signaling and protective mechanisms. By using the why2 T-DNA insertion mutant and a novel knock-out mutant prepared by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, this study revealed that WHIRLY2 is crucial for protecting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity during salt stress. Loss-of-function mutants show an enhanced sensitivity to salt stress. The disruption of WHIRLY2 causes the impairment of mtDNA repair that results in the accumulation of aberrant recombination products, coinciding with severe alterations in nucleoid integrity and overall mitochondria morphology besides a compromised redox-dependent response and misregulation of antioxidant enzymes.

28,A mitochondria-targeting heptamethine cyanine-chlorambucil formulated polymeric nanoparticle to potentiate native tumor chemotherapeutic efficacy.,"Chlorambucil (Cbl) is a DNA alkylating drug in the nitrogen mustard family, but the clinical applications of nitrogen mustard antitumor drugs are frequently limited by their poor aqueous solubility, poor cellular uptake, lack of targeting, and severe side effects. Additionally, mitochondria are the energy factories for cells, and tumor cells are more susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunction than some healthy cells, thus making mitochondria an important target for tumor therapy. As a proof-of-concept, direct delivery of Cbl to tumor cells' mitochondria will probably bring about new opportunities for the nitrogen mustard family. Furthermore, IR775 chloride is a small-molecule lipophilic cationic heptamethine cyanine dye with potential advantages of mitochondria targeting, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging, and preferential internalization towards tumor cells. Here, an amphiphilic drug conjugate was facilely prepared by covalently coupling chlorambucil with IR775 chloride and further self-assembly to form a carrier-free self-delivery theranostic system, in which the two components are both functional units aimed at theranostic improvement. The theranostic IR775-Cbl potentiated typical ""1 + 1 > 2"" tumor inhibition through specific accumulation in mitochondria, which triggered a remarkable decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP generation. <i>In vivo</i> biodistribution and kinetic monitoring were achieved by real-time NIR fluorescence imaging to observe its transport inside a living body.

30,An Inner Mitochondrial Membrane Microprotein from the SLC35A4 Upstream ORF Regulates Cellular Metabolism.,"Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are cis-acting elements that can dynamically regulate the translation of downstream ORFs by suppressing downstream translation under basal conditions and, in some cases, increasing downstream translation under stress conditions. Computational and empirical methods have identified uORFs in the 5'-UTRs of approximately half of all mouse and human transcripts, making uORFs one of the largest regulatory elements known. Because the prevailing dogma was that eukaryotic mRNAs produce a single functional protein, the peptides and small proteins, or microproteins, encoded by uORFs were rarely studied. We hypothesized that a uORF in the SLC35A4 mRNA is producing a functional microprotein (SLC35A4-MP) because of its conserved amino acid sequence. Through a series of biochemical and cellular experiments, we find that the 103-amino acid SLC35A4-MP is a single-pass transmembrane inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) microprotein. The IMM contains the protein machinery crucial for cellular respiration and ATP generation, and loss of function studies with SLC35A4-MP significantly diminish maximal cellular respiration, indicating a vital role for this microprotein in cellular metabolism. The findings add SLC35A4-MP to the growing list of functional microproteins and, more generally, indicate that uORFs that encode conserved microproteins are an untapped reservoir of functional microproteins.",Journal Of Molecular Biology,eng,2024,May,2024-05-12,2024-05-12,"Andréa L Rocha, Victor Pai, Guy Perkins, Tina Chang, Jiao Ma, Eduardo V De Souza, Qian Chu, Joan M Vaughan, Jolene K Diedrich, Mark H Ellisman, Alan Saghatelian","Clayton Foundation Laboratories for Peptide Biology, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38580077/,285.0

In this study, we monitored mitophagy in MuSCS under various myogenic states and examined the role of PINK1 in maintaining regenerative capacity. Results indicate that quiescent MuSCs actively express mitophagy genes and exhibit a measurable mitophagy flux and prominent mitochondrial localization to autophagolysosomes, which become rapidly decreased during activation. Genetic disruption of Pink1 in mice reduces PARKIN recruitment to mitochondria and mitophagy in quiescent MuSCs, which is accompanied by premature activation/commitment at the expense of self-renewal and progressive loss of muscle regeneration, but unhindered proliferation and differentiation capacity. Results also show that impaired fate decisions in PINK1-deficient MuSCs can be restored by scavenging excess mitochondrial ROS.

32,Nano-sized microplastics exposure induces skin cell senescence via triggering the mitochondrial localization of GSDMD.,"Nano-sized microplastic pollution is distributed worldwide. Nano-sized microplastics can enter the blood through the digestive tract, and then transported to various tissues and organs of the body, resulting in a series of toxicological effects. In addition, nano-sized microplastics can penetrate the skin barrier. However, the toxicological effects of nano-sized microplastics on the skin are still not completely understood. Two skin cell lines were used as in vitro models to investigate the toxicological effects of nano-sized microplastics on skin cells and their potential molecular mechanisms. First, cellular behavioral research results showed that nano-sized microplastics can be internalized into skin cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Further experiments using western blotting, indirect immunofluorescence, and ELISA assays demonstrated that nano-sized microplastics cause an increase in skin cell inflammation levels. Additionally, our research showed that nano-sized microplastics caused skin cell senescence damage by evaluating aging-marker molecules such as p16 and p21. Subsequently, we studied the potential molecular mechanism by which nano-sized microplastics cause pathological skin injury and found that they induce mitochondrial oxidative stress, depolarize the mitochondrial membrane potential, and recruit GSDMD to the mitochondria. Subsequently, mtDNA enters the cytoplasm via GSDMD pores, which then activates the AIM2 Inflammasome. Ultimately, it causes a series of biochemical reactions such as inflammation and aging in cells. In an in vivo model, we tested the effect of nano-sized microplastics on skin regeneration and found that they acted as an inhibitor to skin regeneration and aggravated the inflammatory reaction of the skin. Overall, our results provide new evidence of the skin toxicity of nano-sized microplastics. This study provides a theoretical foundation for further research on the potential toxicological effects of nano-sized microplastics on the skin.","Environmental Pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",eng,2024,May,2024-05-04,2024-05-12,"Wang Han, Jiayue Cui, Gao Sun, Xiao Miao, Zhang Pufang, Li Nannan","The First Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery & Oral Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery, Hospital of Stomatology, Jilin University, Changchun, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38552769/,5.0

We recently found that a novel lncRNA ""NR_030777"" demonstrates protective effects on PQ-induced neurodegeneration. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of NR_030777 in the regulation of mitochondrial fission and mitophagy involved in PQ-induced neuronal damage remain to be explored. NR_030777 brain conditional overexpressing mice as well as in vitro primary neuronal cells from cerebral cortex and Neuro2a cells were adopted. Immunofluorescence, Immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to evaluate the expression levels of RNA and proteins. RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pulldown experiment were used to evaluate the interaction of NR_030777 with its target proteins. NR_030777 and mitophagy were increased, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels recovered after NR_030777 overexpression upon PQ treatment. The overexpression and knockdown of NR_030777 unveiled that NR_030777 positively regulated mitophagy such as the upregulation of LC3B-II:I, ATG12-ATG5, p62 and NBR1. Moreover, the application of mdivi-1, a DRP-1 inhibitor, in combination with NR_030777 genetic modified cells unveiled that NR_030777 promoted DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Furthermore, NR_030777 were directly bound to CDK1 to increase p-DRP1 levels at the Ser616 site, leading to mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. On the other hand, NR_030777 acted directly on ATG12 within the ATG12-ATG5 complex in the 800-1400 nt region to modulate the membrane formation. Accordingly, NR_030777 deficiency in neuron cells compromised cell mitophagy. Finally, the above findings were confirmed using NR_030777-overexpressing mice. NR_030777 exerted a protective effect on PQ-exposed mice by enhancing mitophagy. Our data provide the first scientific evidence for the precise invention of PQ-induced PD. Our findings further propose a breakthrough for understanding the regulatory relationship between NR_030777, CDK1, ATG12 and mitophagy in PQ-induced PD.","Environmental Pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",eng,2024,May,2024-05-04,2024-05-04,"Nengzhou Chen, Hong Hu, Jianping Tang, Fuli Zheng, Zhenkun Guo, Xinpei Lin, Michael Aschner, Wenya Shao, Guangxia Yu, Ping Cai, Wei-Chun Chou, Siying Wu, Huangyuan Li","Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350122, China; Department of Labor Hygiene and Environmental Hygiene, School of Public Health, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, 510006, China.

34,NIR-II imaging-guided precise photodynamic therapy for augmenting tumor-starvation therapy by glucose metabolism reprogramming interference.,"Metabolic reprogramming is a mechanism by which cancer cells alter their metabolic patterns to promote cell proliferation and growth, thereby enabling their resistance to external stress. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) can eliminate their energy source by inhibiting glucose glycolysis, leading to cancer cell death through starvation. However, a compensatory increase in mitochondrial metabolism inhibits its efficacy. Herein, we propose a synergistic approach that combines photodynamic therapy (PDT) with starvation therapy to address this challenge. To monitor the nanodrugs and determine the optimal triggering time for precise tumor therapy, a multifunctional nano-platform comprising lanthanide-doped nanoparticle (LnNP) cores was constructed and combined with mesoporous silicon shells loaded with 2DG and photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) in the mesopore channels. Under 980 nm near-infrared light excitation, the downshifted 1550 nm fluorescence signal in the second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) window from the LnNPs was used to monitor the accumulation of nanomaterials in tumors. Furthermore, upconverted 650 nm light excited the Ce6 to generate singlet oxygen for PDT, which damaged mitochondrial function and enhanced the efficacy of 2DG by inhibiting hexokinase 2 and lactate dehydrogenase A expressions. As a result, glucose metabolism reprogramming was inhibited and the efficiency of starvation therapy was significantly enhanced. Overall, the proposed NIR-II bioimaging-guided PDT-augmented starvation therapy, which simultaneously inhibited glycolysis and mitochondria, facilitated the effects of a cancer theranostic system.",Science Bulletin,eng,2024,May,2024-05-04,2024-05-04,"Xiawei Wu, Yong Fan, Kairuo Wang, Yunqiu Miao, Yongliang Chang, Jiang Ming, Xinyue Wang, Shengwei Lu, Ruichi Liu, Fan Zhang, Yang Zhang, Huanlong Qin, Jianlin Shi","Nanomedicine and Intestinal Microecology Research Center, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200072, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38418300/,132.0
35,Genome Editing of Plant Mitochondrial and Chloroplast Genomes.,"Plastids (including chloroplasts) and mitochondria are remnants of endosymbiotic bacteria, yet they maintain their own genomes, which encode vital components for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. Organellar genomes have distinctive features, such as being present as multicopies, being mostly inherited maternally, having characteristic genomic structures and undergoing frequent homologous recombination. To date, it has proven to be challenging to modify these genomes. For example, while CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for editing nuclear genes, it has not yet been successfully applied to organellar genomes. Recently, however, precise gene-editing technologies have been successfully applied to organellar genomes. Protein-based enzymes, especially transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and artificial enzymes utilizing DNA-binding domains of TALENs (TALEs), have been successfully used to modify these genomes by harnessing organellar-targeting signals. This short review introduces and discusses the use of targeted nucleases and base editors in organellar genomes, their effects and their potential applications in plant science and breeding.",Plant & Cell Physiology,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-16,"Shin-Ichi Arimura, Issei Nakazato","Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Science, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1, Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657 Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38113380/,5.0
36,Applications of Synthetic Pentatricopeptide Repeat Proteins.,"RNA-binding proteins play integral roles in the regulation of essential processes in cells and as such are attractive targets for engineering to manipulate gene expression at the RNA level. Expression of transcripts in chloroplasts and mitochondria is heavily regulated by pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. The diverse roles of PPR proteins and their naturally modular architecture make them ideal candidates for engineering. Synthetic PPR proteins are showing great potential to become valuable tools for controlling the expression of plastid and mitochondrial transcripts. In this review, by 'synthetic', we mean both rationally modified natural PPR proteins and completely novel proteins designed using the principles learned from their natural counterparts. We focus on the many different applications of synthetic PPR proteins, covering both their use in basic research to learn more about protein-RNA interactions and their use to achieve specific outcomes in RNA processing and the control of gene expression. We describe the challenges associated with the design, construction and deployment of synthetic PPR proteins and provide perspectives on how they might be assembled and used in future biotechnology applications.",Plant & Cell Physiology,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-16,"Farley Kwok van der Giezen, Suvi Honkanen, Catherine Colas des Francs-Small, Charles Bond, Ian Small","Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Plant Energy Biology, School of Molecular Sciences, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38035801/,5.0
37,Adjunct Therapy With All-trans-Retinoic Acid Improves Therapeutic Efficacy Through Immunomodulation While Treating Tuberculosis With Antibiotics in Mice.,"Tuberculosis is the second leading infectious killer after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Standard antitubercular drugs exhibit various limitations like toxicity, long treatment regimens, and lack of effect against dormant and drug-resistant organisms. Here, we report that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) improves Mycobacterium tuberculosis clearance in mice during treatment with the antitubercular drug isoniazid. Interestingly, ATRA promoted activities of lysosomes and mitochondria, and production of various inflammatory mediators in macrophages. Furthermore, ATRA upregulated the expression of genes of lipid metabolism pathways in macrophages. We demonstrated that ATRA activated the MEK/ERK pathway in macrophages in vitro and MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK pathways in mice. Finally, ATRA induced both Th1 and Th17 responses in lungs and spleens of M. tuberculosis-infected mice. Together, these data indicate that ATRA provides beneficial adjunct therapeutic value by modulating MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK pathways and thus warrants further testing for human use.",The Journal Of Infectious Diseases,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-15,"Baldeep Singh, Isha Pahuja, Priyanka Yadav, Aishwarya Shaji, Shivam Chaturvedi, Anand Ranganathan, Ved Prakash Dwivedi, Gobardhan Das","Special Centre for Molecular Medicine, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37863472/,5.0
38,ATAD3 Proteins: Unique Mitochondrial Proteins Essential for Life in Diverse Eukaryotic Lineages.,"ATPase family AAA domain-containing 3 (ATAD3) proteins are unique mitochondrial proteins that arose deep in the eukaryotic lineage but that are surprisingly absent in Fungi and Amoebozoa. These ∼600-amino acid proteins are anchored in the inner mitochondrial membrane and are essential in metazoans and Arabidopsis thaliana. ATAD3s comprise a C-terminal ATPases Associated with a variety of cellular Activities (AAA+) matrix domain and an ATAD3_N domain, which is located primarily in the inner membrane space but potentially extends to the cytosol to interact with the ER. Sequence and structural alignments indicate that ATAD3 proteins are most similar to classic chaperone unfoldases in the AAA+ family, suggesting that they operate in mitochondrial protein quality control. A. thaliana has four ATAD3 genes in two distinct clades that appear first in the seed plants, and both clades are essential for viability. The four genes are generally coordinately expressed, and transcripts are highest in growing apices and imbibed seeds. Plants with disrupted ATAD3 have reduced growth, aberrant mitochondrial morphology, diffuse nucleoids and reduced oxidative phosphorylation complex I. These and other pleiotropic phenotypes are also observed in ATAD3 mutants in metazoans. Here, we discuss the distribution of ATAD3 proteins as they have evolved in the plant kingdom, their unique structure, what we know about their function in plants and the challenges in determining their essential roles in mitochondria.",Plant & Cell Physiology,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-15,"Elizabeth R Waters, Magdalena Bezanilla, Elizabeth Vierling","Department of Biology, San Diego State University, 5500 Campanille Dr., San Diego, CA 92182, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37859594/,5.0
39,Root Primordium Defective 1 Encodes an Essential PORR Protein Required for the Splicing of Mitochondria-Encoded Group II Introns and for Respiratory Complex I Biogenesis.,"Cellular respiration involves complex organellar metabolic activities that are pivotal for plant growth and development. Mitochondria contain their own genetic system (mitogenome, mtDNA), which encodes key elements of the respiratory machinery. Plant mtDNAs are notably larger than their counterparts in Animalia, with complex genome organization and gene expression characteristics. The maturation of the plant mitochondrial transcripts involves extensive RNA editing, trimming and splicing events. These essential processing steps rely on the activities of numerous nuclear-encoded cofactors, which may also play key regulatory roles in mitochondrial biogenesis and function and hence in plant physiology. Proteins that harbor the plant organelle RNA recognition (PORR) domain are represented in a small gene family in plants. Several PORR members, including WTF1, WTF9 and LEFKOTHEA, are known to act in the splicing of organellar group II introns in angiosperms. The AT4G33495 gene locus encodes an essential PORR protein in Arabidopsis, termed ROOT PRIMORDIUM DEFECTIVE 1 (RPD1). A null mutation of At.RPD1 causes arrest in early embryogenesis, while the missense mutant lines, rpd1.1 and rpd1.2, exhibit a strong impairment in root development and retarded growth phenotypes, especially under high-temperature conditions. Here, we further show that RPD1 functions in the splicing of introns that reside in the coding regions of various complex I (CI) subunits (i.e. nad2, nad4, nad5 and nad7), as well as in the maturation of the ribosomal rps3 pre-RNA in Arabidopsis mitochondria. The altered growth and developmental phenotypes and modified respiration activities are tightly correlated with respiratory chain CI defects in rpd1 mutants.",Plant & Cell Physiology,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-15,"Rana Edris, Laure D Sultan, Corinne Best, Ron Mizrahi, Ofir Weinstein, Stav Chen, Nina A Kamennaya, Nir Keren, Hagit Zer, Hongliang Zhu, Oren Ostersetzer-Biran","Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Edmond J.

40,The Gating Domain of MEF28 Is Essential for Editing Two Contiguous Cytidines in nad2 mRNA in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"In plant organelles, each C-to-U RNA-editing site is specifically recognized by pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins with E1-E2, E1-E2-E+ or E1-E2-DYW domain extensions at the C-terminus. The distance between the PPR domain-binding site and the RNA-editing site is usually fixed at four bases, increasing the specificity of target-site recognition in this system. We here report, in contrast to the general case, on MEF28, which edits two adjacent mitochondrial sites, nad2-89 and nad2-90. When the sDYW domain of MEF28 was replaced with one derived from MEF11 or CRR22, the ability to edit downstream sites was lost, suggesting that the DYW domain of MEF28 provides unique target flexibility for two continuous cytidines. By contrast, substitutions of the entire E1-E2-DYW domains by MEF19E1-E2, SLO2E1-E2-E+ or CRR22E1-E2-E+ target both nad2 sites. In these cases, access to the contiguous sites in the chimeric PPR proteins is likely to be provided by the trans-associated DYW1-like proteins via the replaced E1-E2 or E1-E2-E+ domains. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the gating domain of MEF28 plays an important role in specific target-site recognition of the DYW domain. This finding suggests that the DYW domain and its internal gating domain fine-tune the specificity of the target site, which is valuable information for designing specific synthetic RNA-editing tools based on plant RNA-editing factors.",Plant & Cell Physiology,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-15,"Eszter Bayer-Császár, Anja Jörg, Barbara Härtel, Axel Brennicke, Mizuki Takenaka",NA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37530742/,5.0
41,Chloroplast Ribosome Biogenesis Factors.,"The formation of chloroplasts can be traced back to an ancient event in which a eukaryotic host cell containing mitochondria ingested a cyanobacterium. Since then, chloroplasts have retained many characteristics of their bacterial ancestor, including their transcription and translation machinery. In this review, recent research on the maturation of rRNA and ribosome assembly in chloroplasts is explored, along with their crucial role in plant survival and their implications for plant acclimation to changing environments. A comparison is made between the ribosome composition and auxiliary factors of ancient and modern chloroplasts, providing insights into the evolution of ribosome assembly factors. Although the chloroplast contains ancient proteins with conserved functions in ribosome assembly, newly evolved factors have also emerged to help plants acclimate to changes in their environment and internal signals. Overall, this review offers a comprehensive analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying chloroplast ribosome assembly and highlights the importance of this process in plant survival, acclimation and adaptation.",Plant & Cell Physiology,eng,2024,May,2024-05-15,2024-05-15,"Lisa-Marie Schmid, Nikolay Manavski, Wei Chi, Jörg Meurer","Plant Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Großhaderner Street 2-4, Planegg-Martinsried 82152, Germany.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37498958/,5.0
